# Data-Warehouse-to-Improve-MLB-Team-Performance
Our research project aims to provide valuable insights into Major League Baseball (MLB) teams by analyzing their composition, playersâ€™ profile, and factors influencing their performance. By examining historical data and current trends, we will identify patterns and factors that contribute to team success on the field. This knowledge will help teams strategize and make informed decisions to enhance their competitive edge and attract better players. Additionally, we will explore player demographics, primary positions, and performance metrics to uncover correlations between player attributes and team success. This information will assist teams in player recruitment, contract negotiations, and overall team composition. We will also assess the impact of external factors such as average team salary, hometown weather conditions, and fans' attendance on win percentages. By understanding these relationships, teams can adapt strategies, allocate resources effectively, and engage with their fan base more meaningfully. The outcomes of our research will benefit MLB teams, fans, and stakeholders, enabling datadriven decision-making, deeper fan engagement, and optimized investments in the baseball industry.
